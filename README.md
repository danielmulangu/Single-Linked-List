The Implementation of a single sided linked list using C/C++

This code work for inserting names and data in the linked list as well as removing them using either the name or there empno

---------------------------------------------------

As comon knowledge, the linked list is a sort of data structure that is using nodes and links (Doesn't really make sense), In this code every student represents a nodes and they're all linked to each other with linkes so if we are searching for a particular student, we will have to know the first student in the list and traverse from that first student till the student we are looking for or the last student in the list in case the student we are looking for/ searching is not in the list

---------------------------------------------------

Moreover, this sort of data structure is really efficient when we are dealing with numerous insertions and deletions. However, it is not very practical when the list is huge and when we have to perform multiple search. Because then, we'll have to go through the entire list in most cases.
